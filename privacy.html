<h1>Calibi Sync — Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 15, 2025</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
Calibi Sync (“we,” “our,” or “us”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information.
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your data when you use the Calibi Sync mobile
application (“App”) and related services. By using Calibi Sync, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
If you do not agree, please discontinue use of the App.
</p>

<h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We collect only the information needed to provide and improve Calibi Sync’s features.</p>

<h3>a. Account Information</h3>
<p>
When you sign up or sign in, we may collect your email address, display name, and profile details such as height,
weight, birthday, and wellness goals.
</p>

<h3>b. Cycle &amp; Health Data</h3>
<p>
You may log menstrual cycle details, period symptoms, intimate days, workouts, meal entries, journal entries,
and progress photos. These entries are considered <strong>sensitive health-related data</strong> and are
protected using secure encryption through Supabase.
</p>

<h3>c. Device &amp; Usage Data</h3>
<p>
We may collect anonymized information about your device type, operating system, app version, crash logs,
and general app usage to help us improve performance and experience.
</p>

<h3>d. Payment Data</h3>
<p>
If you subscribe to premium features, payments are processed through the App Store or Google Play via
<strong>RevenueCat</strong>. We do not store your payment card details — only anonymized subscription status
(active / expired).
</p>

<h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>

</ul>
<p>We <strong>never sell or rent</strong> your personal information.</p>

<h2>4. Data Storage &amp; Security</h2>
<p>
Your data is stored securely using <strong>Supabase</strong>, a managed cloud database that encrypts data
both <strong>in transit</strong> and <strong>at rest</strong>. Access is limited to your authenticated
account only. Supabase maintains compliance with industry standards such as SOC 2 and ISO 27001.
</p>
<p>
While we take reasonable measures to protect your information, no electronic storage system is completely secure,
and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
</p>

<h2>5. Sharing &amp; Third-Party Access</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Supabase</strong> — to host, authenticate, and securely store your data.</li>
<li><strong>RevenueCat</strong> — to manage subscriptions and verify purchases.</li>
<li><strong>Analytics tools (if enabled)</strong> — for anonymous usage metrics only.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do <strong>not</strong> share personally identifiable health data with advertisers or other third parties.</p>

<h2>6. Your Rights &amp; Controls</h2>

<h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
<p>
We retain your data only while your account is active. When you delete your account, all associated information and files
are permanently deleted from our systems.
</p>

<h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>

By using Calibi Sync, you consent to these international transfers.
</p>
